- expand and deepen our understanding of our individual learning process & dynamics within a team 
- build a multi-page application using React Router, an api of our choosing, and a new technology

## Challenges & Wins:
- learning a new technology on our own and using it in an application over less than 2 weeks was a challenge and a win
- our projct team had great work processes facilitated by excellent communication, daily standups, and a github project board
